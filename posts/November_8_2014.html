								<p>Shorter Hunt, alot less evidence, but some cool responses.</p>
								<p>
									This was one of the coolest responses ever, we were doing an Echovox session in the kitchen. One of the LVPIT investigators was listening
									in on our session. All of a sudden this came over-
								</p>
								<audio src="../audio/nov_8_2014/basement-funny.mp3" controls></audio>
								<p class="comment">'basement-funny'</p>
								<p>
									The investigator then radioed down to the basement where other members had a group of people doing an investigation. They radiod back that he was about to tell a funny story to the group. Amazing!
								</p>
								<p>
									Next pretty amazing EVP we got was in the attic with the group, this EVP is very faint so please crank it up and use headphones.
								</p>
								<audio src="../audio/nov_8_2014/Yoo Hoo.mp3" controls></audio>
								<p>
									You can hear the investigators response, it was one of the very rare times an EVP was heard in real time. Again this was an amazing response.
								</p>
								<p>
									Next, still in the attic (yes the attic is a hotspot at the Sun Inn) He asks if they call the little girl up there Sweetie,
								</p>
								<audio src="../audio/nov_8_2014/Uh huh.mp3" controls></audio>
								<p>
									Those of you with kids, remember asking them a question when their attention is on something else, the give you a faint 'uh-huh' response, that's what this sounds like to me.
								</p>
								<p>
									Here's another Echovox reply, I honestly can't remember where we were maybe the Great Room.
								</p>
								<audio src="../audio/nov_8_2014/Hi_its possible.mp3"  controls></audio>
								<p class="comment">
									Hi, its possible?
								</p>
								<p>
									Like I said this was a shorter hunt, only a few hours. That's paranormal investigating in a nutshell. Sometimes you don't get alot of responses but what you do get it kinda amazing. Thanks to the <a href="http://www.glvpit.com/"> LVPIT </a> guys and gals. They do a great job!
