                <p>If you do decide to investigate graveyards and just concentrate on EVP's without the aid of ghost boxes or ITC apps like we have done you almost have to retrain yourself. You actually get alot of EVP's but very few class "A" ones, this is because they are usually VERY faint. Add to the fact there is usually alot of background noise so when you amplify the EVP - usually only the background noise amplifies. I'll play some of these super faint ones and as usually don't even bother unless you have earphones on, or if you have a desktop with a good speaker system they will work OK. Laptops usually have poor speakers for EVP's. Also Linux OS's seem to have trouble with volume. Also a bit of what even amatuer web developers have to deal with, audio formats. For EVP's you want a "lossless" format like .avi or .wma. Except that since Internet Explorer won't work with HTML 5...... I'm forced to convert them to MP3's, which is NOT IDEAL for EVP's. Technical jargon I know just be known that Microsoft SUCKS. Yes those are audio formats THEY came up with that don't work with their OWN web browser. I have to code pages everyone can see and hear, so comprimises have to be made. All those boring disclaimers out of the way now, lets get to the EVP's....</p>

								<p>First one is pretty typical of what you get in graveyards, you really have no idea what was said. It may be a name of someone whose grave we walked by. As you can tell we were just walking thru the leaves...
								<h4 class="underline text-center">EVP 1</h4>
								<audio src="../audio/nov_11_2016/EVP1.mp3" controls></audio></p><br>

								<p>Next one is another typical residual EVP. This one is pretty clean, almost a class "A". He's either saying "old" or "cold". Let us know what you think.
								<h4 class="underline text-center">EVP 2</h4>
								<audio src="../audio/nov_11_2016/EVP2.mp3" controls></audio></p><br>

								<p>Next one is a cool one. This one is kinda complex so we will go thru it 3 times. There is a class A EVP near the end, of course its saying some totally non-sensical to the enviroment we were in (It was a dry day and hadn't rained in a week). We will play the EVP all the way thru the first time with no repeating, pay special attention to after my wife says "That time of the year is comin'" and right before I say "51 he was only 50" - I was talking about when the guy on the tombstone died.

	                    <p>Well why not? The thing you are looking for is spirit energy. Strong emotions associated with certain graves seem to elicit responses. I've read some paranormal investigators don't belive in investigating them, I tend to disagree. We seem to get more responses there than anywhere else. Plus there are graveyards EVERYWHERE! Walking through one is like walking thru time. Some have very old sections that have graves of people who fought in the Revolutionary War.....War of 1812....World War 1.

											You see sad stories develop at the grave of a child only a few days old, at one place there were 4 graves of children all together. The incredible sadness that family must have felt is heart breaking. If you do decide to hit some graveyards, be respectful. People with loved ones at eternal rest there don't want ghost hunters tramping all over the place. Try to pick ones that are not near major roads, strange as it seems the lonelier locations seem to give more responses. Also alot of the responses we get seem to be residual. Finally most cemetaries have hours of operation, usually dawn to dusk. You may have to be stealthy if you decide to try your IR and night vision cameras, again please be respectful!!</p>
