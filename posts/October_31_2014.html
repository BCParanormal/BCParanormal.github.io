                <p>Night started slowly, alot of people there including some "whisperers" who are the bane of paranormal investigators. Also notice on alot of the EchoVox sound files you hear alot of background noise like walkie-talkies. This is where EchoVox really shines, background noise doesn't really phase it. First real "contact" was in the basement. We we told that you WILL get a "help me" EVP there. Its sort of a Sun Inn tradition. You will hear a noise like someone who is unwrapping a twinkie, then the EVP. You then hear the lead investigator tell about a supposed vortex in the middle of the basement.</p>
        				<p class="CenAud"><audio src="../audio/oct_31_2014/help_me.mp3" controls></audio></p>
        				<p>Pretty promising start, tho at the time we heard nothing which is typical of EVP's. We then moved around a bit, heard more history of the place. We really didn't get much else until we set up with the Echovox. First room we investigated was the great room. Got some really interesting responses here. First a little info on EchoVox. Its what is called an ITC app. It uses a bank of phenomes ramdomly. Its the noise you here. Each phenome is 1/10th of a second long. So if you hear a 3 word sentence, its really cool since, again, there are no words in ExchoVox- just random phenomes. There are 3 sound banks, I was having better luck on bank B so I switched it and got a rather sarcastic response.</p>
        				<p><audio src="../audio/oct_31_2014/perfect_push_the_button.mp3" controls></audio></p>
        				<p class="comment"> We hear "perfect", then "push the button"</p>
        				<p>Then I tried to get how many spirits were here.....</p>
        				<p><audio src="../audio/oct_31_2014/how_many_10.mp3" controls></audio></p>
        				<p>Then came the one that shocked us, in fact when I played it for my mom she got seriously creeped out. Since we had been around the hotel a few times this was my second time back in the great room. I asked if they remembered me....</p>
        				<p><audio src="../audio/oct_31_2014/goodman_EVP.mp3" controls></audio></p>
        				<p class="comment">"I did" then "goodman"</p>
        				<p>Then we tried like heck to get them to say my wife's name. Keep in mind <em>living</em> people mess up her name. She prefers it to be pronounced "CUH-REEN". Like you careen your car off a cliff. Got it? </p>
        				<p><audio src="../audio/oct_31_2014/how_many_women.mp3" controls></audio></p>
        				<p>Next we tried to get a man's name out, Apparently I was speaking too softly...</p>
        				<p><audio src="../audio/oct_31_2014/excuse_me.mp3" controls></audio></p>
        				<p>Next it was off to the attic, where supposedly the spirit of a little girl lives. Our experience was, lets say, not child like. In fact we actually had some verbal battles with whatever was up there. We heard the "F" word lots of times. That audio file is so busy I still have not gone thru it all. This was one of the exchanges..... </p>
        				<p><audio src="../audio/oct_31_2014/You_poor_bastard.mp3" controls></audio></p>
        				<p class="comment">"you poor bastard" then "F-off"</p>
        				<p>The night was wild, we were getting "hits" everywhere. In fact I have yet to go thru all the audio. Big thanks to the
